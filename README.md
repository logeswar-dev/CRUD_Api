# CRUD_Api
Creating a CRUD Api using nodejs and express to store user information 

Here I m using a mock database to prove the concept 

This is CRUD restApi which allows you to create,read,update,delete since browser 
accepts only get request i used to Postman to send Post,Delete,Patch requests 
and differentiated with id using node uuid package
